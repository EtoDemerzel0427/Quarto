# Quarto
Quarto is a toy-level, self-implemented deep learning library with autograd.

## Content

Quarto is now under planning. Similar to PyTorch, in the first stage, we will implement:

1. A Tensor module. There should be a Tensor class based on NumPy array.
2. Layers. A base Layer class, and some common layers, e.g, `conv2d`. (should belongs to `nn` module)
3. Functional. (should belongs to `nn` module)
4. init. (should belongs to `nn` module)
